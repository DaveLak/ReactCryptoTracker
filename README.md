# Archived & Unmaintained.

I created this repo to play around and it served that purpose. I don't plan to come back to it so instead of deleteing it I've chosen to archive it.

Feel free to clone or fork it but please understand the **project dependencies may have security issues** and should be inspected before use.

Cheers :)
